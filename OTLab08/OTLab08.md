## üìù Tasks

- [ ] 1Ô∏è‚É£ Verify the IP and MAC addresses of the `pc1` workstation.
- [ ] 2Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the subnet mask associated with the `pc1` workstation.
- [ ] 3Ô∏è‚É£ Repeat the previous steps for the workstations `pc2`, `pc3`, `pc4`, `pc5`, and `pc6`. Compare the addressing schemes and determine the underlying segmentation logic.
- [ ] 4Ô∏è‚É£ From `pc1`, use the `ping` command to test connectivity with `pc2` and `pc3`. Provide an interpretation of the results.
- [ ] 5Ô∏è‚É£ From `pc1`, attempt to `ping` `pc4`. Evaluate the outcome.
- [ ] 6Ô∏è‚É£ From `pc5`, attempt to `ping` `pc6`. Analyze the results.
- [ ] 7Ô∏è‚É£ Execute the `ipcalc` command from any container to calculate the network information relevant to this study.
    - *Identify the network address, broadcast address, and number of available hosts*.
- [ ] 8Ô∏è‚É£ On `pc2`, run `traceroute <IP address of pc4>` and explain the observed routing path.
- [ ] 9Ô∏è‚É£ On `pc2`, execute `traceroute <IP address of pc3>` and interpret the resulting path.
- [ ] üîü From `pc3`, perform a network discovery scan using `nmap -sn <network_address/24>` for each network analyzed in this study. Identify the active hosts detected.

## üîñ Nomenclature

- IP: Internet protocol.
- MAC: Media access control.
